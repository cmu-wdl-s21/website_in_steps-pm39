      <h2>Big Important Things!</h2>

      <p>It's amazing what you can do with a little love in your heart. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see. We need dark in order to show light. Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs.</p>

      <p>This is the way you take out your flustrations. When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing.</p>

      <p>If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness. We'll play with clouds today. Automatically, all of these beautiful, beautiful things will happen.</p>

      <p>Let the paint work. Any little thing can be your friend if you let it be. La- da- da- da- dah. Just be happy. Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day. Just a happy little shadow that lives in there.</p>

      <h2>Less Important Things</h2>

      <p>Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. It's all a game of angles. You can do anything here. So don't worry about it. Even the worst thing we can do here is good. Van Dyke Brown is a very nice brown, it's almost like a chocolate brown. Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds.</p>

      <p>Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at? This is a fantastic little painting. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. Let's have a nice tree right here. There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens. I'm going to mix up a little color. Weâ€™ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue.</p>

      <p>There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend. Zip. That easy. Now, we're going to fluff this cloud. Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it.</p>
